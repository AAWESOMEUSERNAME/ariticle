                    Musicality in the Old Timer world is an enormous part of why they danced the way they did. It’s
                    a topic I’m infatuated with, and these conclusions may not last long as I keep thinking, or as I
                    discuss this topic with others. But I hope you will find something interesting or inspiring in
                    them. In our last installment, music began to enter into our equation when we mentioned how
                    different a night of dancing would have been to a dancer who would have heard the same style of
                    swing dance music played almost every night of a year. For this installment, we dive a lot
                    deeper into the Old Timer dancers and how music effected their dancing.
                    <div class="ch">
                        在根源舞者的世界里，音乐性对他们的跳舞方式影响巨大。这是一个我很着迷的话题，接下来说的这些结论，可能会在我的反复思考
                        或与别人的讨论后发生变化。但是我希望你能从中获得启发和乐趣。在上一个部分，音乐开始进入我们的反应方程式，我们提到如果
                        一个舞者一整年几乎每晚听到的音乐都是同样风格会产生多大的不同。这个部分，我们会进一步深挖音乐对根源舞者跳舞的影响。
                    </div>
                </em></div>
            <div class="h2">The Only Count I know is Basie</div>
            <div class="p">Imagine you’re a dancer in the 1930s.
                Dancing for you means going out at several nights a week, and every night to a different big band, each
                one using different arrangements.
                When the leader announces he’s going to play “Flying Home,” you don’t know anything about how the song
                is going to sound except that the melody will roughly go “Bad-da-daaa, da-da-dadadum…Bad-da-daaa,
                da-da-dadadum…etc.”
                <div class="ch">
                    如果你是一个1930年代的舞者，跳舞意味着每周出去好几次，每次都跟着不同的大乐队跳舞，不同的乐队有不同的编排。
                    当乐队领班说接下来演奏“flying home”时，你根本不知道接下来这首歌听起来什么样，唯一确定的就是旋律大概是“Bad-da-daaa, da-da-dadadum…Bad-da-daaa,
                    da-da-dadadum…这样.”
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="p">
                Any of the intricate stuff in this night’s arrangement, or the improvised notes a soloist adds to the
                music make listening to it enjoyable and rewarding, but the chances of you as a dancer being able to
                change your dancing specifically to all those tiny sections as they fly by your ears are slim,
                especially because they would take such mental effort and skill that it’d probably be too mentally
                frustrating to even try it. The result–you’d spend more time dancing musically to the overall
                phrasing or big-picture melody, the overall flow of the music. It’s the “flying home” melody, after
                all. And if you don’t get it the first few times, they’ll repeat it. Sure, the arranger might switch
                it up a bit, tweak it a little, but you can work with that a lot easier than trying to be incredibly
                musical on every small thing that passes by. You can hit things in the small part of the music, but
                it’s through subtle, small changes in your overall movements–things that are easier to manipulate in
                the moment.
                <div class="ch">
                    这些复杂的编排或者独奏者的即兴会使当晚的音乐十分令人享受，但是你作为一个舞者几乎不可能精确的根据那些一闪而过的音乐细节
                    用舞蹈做出回应，这种回应是很费脑子的，所以哪怕只是试一试，都可能让你头疼到自闭。结果就是，你开始花更多的时间
                    去跟着整体的结构，整体旋律，整个音乐的流动感去表达自己的音乐性。毕竟这是“flying home”的旋律，即使最开始你可能反应
                    不过来，后面还会重复的。尽管作曲者可能对原曲进行一些改动，但是相较于所有音乐细节都去跟，依然要简单不少。你可以去
                    回应那些音乐中的细节，但是这种回应都是穿插在整体运动中的小变换，一些更容易在运动中控制的小动作。
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="p">Now, put yourself in your modern dance shoes.
                When you go out dancing, you <em>will</em> hear the Fat’s Waller recording of “All that meat and no
                potatoes,” which you have heard fifty seven times this year alone. (For me, that’s fine; it’s a good
                song.)
                You know every note of that song, sub consciously if not consciously.
                When you dance to it, you will probably be able to hit and emphasize all the minor musical intricacies
                very well.
                <div class="ch">
                    现在回到你现代舞者的立场。
                    当你出去跳舞的时候，你很有可能会听到Fat’s Waller的《All that meat and no potatoes》，一首你仅这一年你就已经听了57次的曲子。
                    （对我来说这没什么，这歌挺好的。）
                    你清楚的知道这首歌的每一个细节，即使不是有意识的记住，也已经在潜意识里记住。
                    当你跳这首曲子时，你可能有能力去很好的击中或强调所有细微的复杂音乐性。
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="p">Now, here’s where it gets strange:
                When you suddenly hear a song you don’t know, you might still try to dance to the musical intricacies in
                it.
                If the song isn’t full of obvious swing music cliches that will make that easy, you will have a rough
                flow, or make some mistakes and end up looking really un-musical, and walk away from the dance not
                satisfied with the musicality in your dance.
                <div class="ch">
                    接下来要发生的事情就有点奇怪了：
                    当你突然听到一首你不知道的曲子，你可能还会想去跳那些复杂的音乐性。如果那首歌不是简单的千篇一律的流行摇摆乐，你可能会跳的很僵硬，
                    或者犯很多错误，结果看起来跳的十分没有音乐性，最后在挫败中黯然离场。
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="p">You have become a micro-musicality dancer.
                You have trained your musicality muscles to mainly focus on the small stuff, perhaps because you have
                equated “musicality” to mean “being able to dance to a song’s musical changes very intricately.”
                If you are a follow, this is not a problem, but a strength–it’s the only way for you to play a major
                roll in musicality, since the leader interprets all the bigger movements (More on this later.)
                If you’re a leader and this describes you, then you have forgotten how to take pleasure and satisfaction
                in your overall “big-picture” musicality.
                This is a very large difference between the old time dancer and the new.
                <div class="ch">
                    你已经变成了一个细碎音乐性舞者。你已经把自己的音乐性肌肉训练成了主要关注细小的东西，可能因为你把“音乐性”等价的理解为
                    “有能力去跟着音乐中复杂的变化跳舞。”如果你是一个follower，这不是个大问题，反而是优势——这是你仅有的可以主导的音乐性表达，因为
                    leader掌控着所有大的移动（之后再详谈。）
                    如果你是一个这样的leader，那么你已经忘记了如何在大的音乐性中寻找乐趣和满足。这是根源舞者和当代舞者一个很大的差异。
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="p">
                I began thinking about this topic after talking to Nick Williams and David Rehm, who had the topic as
                a part of a musicality class they put on together.
                They told me how they had noticed the old time dancers phrased<sup>1</sup> for their musicality, whereas
                a lot of
                new dancers seem to put more emphasis on what we call micro-musicality; the minute musical stuff.
                They deserve credit for planting the seed that began my own explorations into old-timer musicality.
                The more I thought about it, the more obvious sense it made, and the more I could formulate<em> why</em>
                it was that way for an old timer dancer.
                This was when I composed the opening paragraph, a little speech I give in classes on musicality.
                This musicality is a very important aspect to why classic dancing looks the way it does.
                <div class="ch">
                    我是因为和Nick Williams、David Rehm交谈了一次才开始思考这个话题的，他们把这部分东西放在了他们关于音乐性的课程里。
                    他们告诉了我他们发现的根源舞者们组织自己音乐性的方式，不同于现代舞者似乎更在意所谓的细节音乐性——那些转瞬即逝的东西。
                    是他们在我心里埋下了探索老舞者音乐性的种子，此处特别鸣谢。随着我的不断思考，这种感觉越来越明显，我也得以逐渐演算出
                    根源舞者们以那种方式跳舞的原因。
                    这是为我在音乐性系列课程上一段小演讲做准备时想到的东西。
                    音乐性是根源舞者之所以跳出那种样子的原因中一个很重要的切面。

            <div class="p">
                For instance, look at Hellzapoppin, which was originally choreographed to “Jumpin’ at the Woodside,”
                but because it was danced to overall phrases, fits nicely into other songs. Look at the California,
                a piece of choreography that is universal to almost any AABA song. Look at Al Minns dancing to
                Jumpin at the Woodside at 1:15 in this clip. (<a

                <div class="ch">
                    作为例证，我们先来看一下Hellzapopping，这个最开始基于《Jumpin’ at the Woodside》设计的编舞因为是跟着大
                    结构跳的，所以可以很好的适配其他曲子。看看California routine那一段，基本可以跳所有AABA的曲子。看看Al Minns在

            <div class="p">
                Since the old timer did most of their social dancing to live music, and thus their musicality was
                refined to live music, I think an old time dancer evolves their movements roughly in proportion to
                the importance of things in the music. Overall pulse and the way they step is determined by the
                songs feeling and mood. The songs melody and phrasing commands their big movements, like turns and
                patterns. The small stuff in the music gets a proportionately small amount of attention.
                <div class="ch">

                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="p">
                I’m not suggesting that modern dancers should give up their micro-musicality–it’s a great
                tool, show’s great skill, and makes it fun to dance to certain songs repeatedly;
                it’s a natural product of the DJ dance world.
                In a way, it’s something important we have contributed to the dance, like advanced frame and comfortable
                lead/follow skills.
                But I do think we should (1) remember phrasing is an important, powerful, and subtle musicality skill,
                and that (2) we need to always keep our micro-musicality in proportion, lest it dominate our dancing.
            </div>
            <div class="p">Where micro-musicality probably did come into play with old timers was jazz tropes–Swing
                music can be pretty predictable, and so I think a lot of micro-musicality evolved out of those
                predictable jazz moments.
                For instance, we all know that if we hear “Shave and a haircut,” we can almost guarantee a
                “TWO BITS!” will follow.
                Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers make constant use of the swing tropes in “Follow the Fleet,” where the
                bugle call rag trumpet always prompts them to tap-out the final part, no matter what they’re doing at
                the time.
                Jazz tropes were so common that band leaders like Artie Shaw began setting up Jazz tropes only to twist
                their endings to psych-out listeners (In Artie’s case, often specifically to piss off dancers, whom he
                despised).**
            </div>
            <div class="p">
                For leaders, I think this is why old timer’s tend to have a few fancy moves to bust out when people
                are watching, but otherwise dance a whole bunch of basic movements that they alter slightly with
                footwork or feel.
                In most of the social dancing we have, like Bobby McGees, or even the Spirit Moves
                jams, or even Frankie Manning, a master of innovative moves (<a
                    href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e00F7OimG6U"
                    rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e00F7OimG6U</a>), we see leaders dominantly
                keeping to basic moves and playing within those moves.
            </div>
            <div class="p">
                Here’s the great news, thanks to in-depth thinking and research done on musicality by my partner and
                a classically-trained musician, Kate Hedin: Micro-musicality has liberated the swing dance follower.
                Since they have almost no control over the lead moves of the dance, and more-or-less have to match
                their partners for pulse and flow, followers in history have not had a chance to do much more than
                generic “this is the mood of the song” musicality and throwing in small, odd stylings–there is very
                little instances of follower-specific musicality in old timer footage.
                But while a follower has no control over the lead moves, she can hit the small stuff.
                Great modern day followers are capable of expressing what they feel to the music very specifically.
            </div>
            <div class="p">
                The way the old timers thought of phrasing points to a broader point of how they experienced music
                differently than we tend to.
                Norma Miller used to say, famously “The only count I know is Basie.”
            </div>
            <div class="p">
                The Count Basie pun is easy to say (and nod your head at, soulfully and knowingly) but hard for some
                dancers, especially new ones or musically trained ones, to fully understand right away.
                It’s incredibly common for someone in a beginner class to ask “Why is a turn 6-counts–doesn’t that mess
                things up, musically?”<sup>3</sup>
                What Norma means, to be very technical about it, is that the original dancers had no training in counts,
                and didn’t assume any rules about moves taking 4 or 8 counts to do so that they fit perfectly into the
                structure of swing music.
                (Besides, anyone who sees strict 8-count dancing can see how repetitive and predictable it looks after a
                few moments, something you don’t want swing dancing to look or feel like).
            </div>
            <div class="p">
                Today, we summarize it by saying the original dancers did a lot of 8-count moves, because they are
                musical, but when it got down to it, only really cared about 2-count chunks, or up-beats and down
                beats.
                Those two-beat chunks are the basic Legos of swing music, and a dancer just puts those Legos
                together.
                That’s why you can break almost all moves easily into 2-beat chunks.
                (For instance, a side pass– a rock-step two-beat chunk, a triple step two-beat chunk, and another triple
                step two-beat chunk.)
            </div>
            <div class="p">
                The pros to not concerning yourself with counts is that as a dancer, you can spend more time
                paying attention to the music, and allowing your movements to be driven by it naturally rather than
                specific dance steps set to pre-planned times.
                The cons to not thinking about counts is the simple fact that understanding counts are a great way to
                learn dance and a great way to control and hone rhythm and keep it from getting messy, which a lot of
                dancers who don’t pay attention to counts have problems with.

                1. I’d like to explain why I have chosen to use the word “phrasing.”
                The old timers (for the most part) didn’t think of their music in technical terms, and phrasing is most
                definitely a technical word, so in that sense, it doesn’t seem like it’s the perfect choice. But as a
                term, a “phrase” of jazz music describes nicely the small musical stories that are told in a swing song.
                It describes the build-up and climax of a melody which are precisely the parts of music a good dancer
                would have been paying attention to.
                It is for this reason that I think “phrasing” is perhaps the best one-word way of describing their sense
                of big-picture musicality.
            </div>
            <div class="p">
                But, to be more specific, the big picture parts of the music that would have been the priority of the
                old timers also include the mood of the music (energetic phrases and drum solos compared to mellow
                phrases and piano solos) and the melodic narrative as a whole.
                If at any point in this discussion I get too white, just let me know.

                2. Artie Shaw was an infamous grouch. Among one of the many things he disliked was dancers, whom he
                thought would dance to “a windshield wiper” as long as it had a steady beat.
                It is apparently because of this dislike that his soloist would break the form of jazz tropes, and his
                drummers would often hit odd beats to accentuate the music.
                Perhaps to Artie’s corpse’s chagrin, the result was a group of songs that became a great tool for swing
                choreographers like Kevin and Carla in the early 2000s, who found Artie’s songs so interesting that they
                inspired original and interesting choreography.

            <div class="p">
                So, imagine Artie Shaw being asked to make a “soundie,” the 1930s equivalent of a music video.
                Many of them had dancing as part of their production, but Artie Shaw refused having dancers being filmed
                while his musicians were playing and should get all the attention.
                But, Artie Shaw was a favorite dance band of the era, and its understandable the producers would want to
                market to that audience.
                In the soundie for ” Lady Be Good,” the producers found their loophole: by filming collegiate shag
                dancers separately on a different sound stage on a different day, they faded the dancing shots in
                and out over the video for the band.

                3. My own answer for why a turn can take 6-beats: It’s the perfect amount of time for one turn to
                take.
                Four counts is too fast for every turn.
                Eight counts is too long.
                Six is just right.
