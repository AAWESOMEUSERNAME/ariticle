            <div class="p">The great depression caused such a stifling melancholy on the country, it actually makes
                sense that people would
                spend money they couldn't afford to go out and hear great jazz and forget their troubles. For
                mild-mannered
                teenagers in America, the explosion of swing music expressed an excitement that sharply contrasted the
                boring,
                sugar-sweet music their parents listened to, and we all know how important music is to teenage
                culture.<sup>1</sup>
                Swing
                music and swing rhythm itself can be characterized by its paradoxically relaxed but driving release of
                energy.
                <div class="ch">
                    经济大萧条使整个国家都淹没在令人窒息的忧伤中，这实际上说通了为什么那时人们愿意花他们实际上负担不起的钱去听爵士乐以忘却烦恼。
                    对于一向温文尔雅的美国青少年来说，摇摆乐的大爆发表达了一种和父辈听的无聊的小甜曲对比鲜明的兴奋感，我们也都明白音乐在青少年文化中有多重要。<sup>1</sup>
                    摇摆乐和摇摆节奏的一大标志性特点就是轻松却饱含能量。
                    （译者注：摇摆乐自身的矛盾感和新一代青少年与父辈间的审美矛盾形成了有趣的对照？）
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="p">An original swing dancer probably released a great deal of their pent-up physical, emotional,
                and social energy through a night of dancing.
                Think about it: A modern person can do a million things to
                entertain
                themselves
                physically and emotionally. In the 1930s, and during the great depression, even a person who lived in
                the city had much more limited options. For most average Americans, movies, dancing, or drinking at a
                bar were probably the main desires as far as leaving the house, (which, come to think of it, is not very
                different from several of my friends). And only one of those was a place where a teenager could meet
                other people and socialize.
                Aside from the malt shop, it's where teenagers met up before the age of arcades, malls, concerts, and
                cocaine orgies.
                And even malt shops had records and dancing. It's also not surprising because, as we all know, swing
                dancing is fun as hell.
                <div class="ch">
                    根源舞者跳舞的一晚释放了相当多平时无处释放的能量——生理性的，情绪性的，社交性的。 思考一下：一个现代人，有千千万万的方式去取悦自己的身体和精神。
                    在30年代，大萧条期间，即使是生活在城市里的人也选择有限。对于大多数美国老百姓，电影，跳舞，去酒吧喝酒是出门后
                    主要想干的几件事（仔细想一下，我的几个朋友也差不多就是这样）。这其中只有一个地方允许青少年和其他人见面社交。
                    在够年龄去街机厅、商场、音乐会、可卡因聚会前，青少年一般约在甜品店旁见面。而即使甜品店也可以听歌跳舞。也没什么好
                    惊讶的，我们也都知道，摇摆舞好玩的要死。
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="p">Let's take a California teenager, or even a person living near the Savoy, like a young
                Frankie Manning or Norma
                Miller. That person could easily dance almost every night of the week, to incredible live, big bands
                whose sole
                (and soul) purpose was playing for dancers. (A much-more-complicated-than-you-would-think art, and a
                lost one,
                with the exception of a handful of modern bands).<sup>2</sup>
                <div class="ch">
                    具体一点，我们来看一下一个加州青少年，或者随便一个生活在Savoy的人——比如年轻的Frankie Manning或者Norma Miller。
                    这么个人可以很方便的跟着绝佳的，唯一目的（或者终极追求）就是为舞者演奏的现场大乐队每天跳舞。（大乐队，一种或许比你
                    想象的复杂得多的艺术形式，一种遗失的技艺——当代大乐队，用手都数的过来。）<sup>2</sup>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="p">Anyway, that teenager that could dance five nights a week was, like most teenagers, probably
                interested in gaining acceptance with their peers and dates with members of the opposite sex.
                This means, realistically, a good portion of their dance energy was probably spent towards impressing
                their partner or competing with (friendly or not friendly) rivals.
                Or, take Frankie and Norma, who had to constantly one-up dancers like Shorty Snowden to get recognition.
                Anyway you look at it, showing off was a part of the spirit of the original
                jitterbugs.<sup>3</sup> For instance, can you name any other partner dance where it's common practice to
                have
                people all
                of a sudden start clapping around another couple and then have people take turns exhibiting their dance?
                The
                fact that Jam Circles were a part of jazz dance beautifully illustrates this spirit.
                <div class="ch">
                    总之，这么个一周可以跳5天年轻人可能主要是想赢得同龄人的认可然后和异性约会——就像大多数青少年那样。这就意味着实际上
                    相当一部分他们跳舞的能量估计是为了让自己的舞伴印象深刻，或者和自己的对手友善的（或不友善的）竞争。
                    或者，就拿Frankie和Norma来讲，需要不断的战胜如Shorty Snowden这样的舞者来获得认可。
                    仔细观察就能发现，“炫耀”是根源精神的一部分。<sup>3</sup>具体的证据就是，你能说得出任何一个其他双人舞会习惯于一群人突然开始
                    围着一对舞者鼓掌然后大家轮流上去竭尽所能跳舞么？Jam Circles是爵士舞中的一部分这个事实就是对这种精神的绝好展示。
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="p">And I don't think it's a bad thing. A lot of us who grew up in the 90s, were taught, often
                subconsciously, that being a competitive person is at root a bad thing;
                that putting focus on one-upping someone else is contradictory to the more kindly spirit of simply
                trying your best and enjoying what you're doing.
                The old dancers, if they thought about it at all, didn't think the two ideas were contradictory.
                I believe almost all tried their best and enjoyed what they were doing, part of which was the game of
                trying to one-up their friends and rivals.
                It's a pretty easy impression to get from talking to old timers, or by reading Norma Miller's Book,
                the Savoy Section of Marshall Stearns's <em>Jazz Dance</em>, and Frankie Manning's autobiography.
                It's a form of competition that, if fostered in a healthy way, can lead to incredibly inspiring
                dancing.<sup>4</sup>
                <div class="ch">
                    我不认为这是一件坏事。我们90后中有很多人在潜意识里总觉得喜欢竞争是有原罪的；这种想法把战胜其他人这种行为，
                    放到了友善的尽自己所能并享受过程的对立面。老舞者们，如果曾经试图想过这个问题，根本不觉得这两者是对立的。
                    我相信他们几乎所有人都有尽自己所能且享受过程，而这也是他们和朋友或对手“争第一”游戏的一部分。
                    通过和他们对话，或者看Norma Miller的书，或者Marshall Stearns的Jazz Dance中的Savoy Section一节，又或者
                    Frankie Manning的传记，会很容易感受到这样的印象。如果组织得当，这种形式的竞赛会催生出极具启发性的舞蹈。<sup>4</sup>

            </div>
            <div class="p">
                It helps to clarify that (1) “showing off” has a modern negative connotation implying a vain
                act, and though I do
                think vanity probably creeps into it somewhere for a lot of people, I don't believe it's a necessary
                part of it
                and I'd prefer for people to look on it more as a neutral term for “displaying their skills” and (2)
                there are
                different ways to show off.
                <div class="ch">
                    这说明了几件事：（1）“炫耀”在现代有一种意味着虚荣的内涵。诚然，对很多人来说虚荣确实会在某些时候衍生出炫耀行为，
                    但我不认为“炫耀”不必然是因为虚荣，我希望人们能将“炫耀”看作“技能展示”的一种自然形式。（2）“炫耀”可以有多种形式。
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="p">Of course, the modern dance scene, especially a lot of competitors, don't seem to have much
                of a problem with wanting to show off. But I think there are several important problems with the way
                many of the modern dancers choose to show off.
                (For instance, I think it's easy for many competitors to choose the form of showing off where you say
                “Here's what I can do, can you do it?”, whereas a more difficult, and more artistic, way to show
                off is “This is who I am, who are you?” That's what I see so clearly when I see Al and Leon dance next
                to each other.
                Of course, an up-and-coming swing modern competitor should not be expected to have reached the level of
                self-expression of veterans like Al and Leon.) But that's something we'll talk about later.
                <div class="ch">
                    当然，在现代摇摆舞圈，特别是比赛的舞者，不缺“炫耀”的动力。但是我觉得很多当代舞者的“炫耀”方式有一些很重要的问题。
                    （比如，我觉得当代比赛选手很容易选择一种心态如“我能做这个，你能么？”的“炫耀”方式，但是一种更难也更艺术性的“炫耀”方式
                    是“这就是我，那你是谁？”这是我在看Al和Leon一起跳舞时明显感受到的。当然，我们不能奢求一个有前途新晋当代选手可以比肩
                    像Al和Leon那样自我表达老手。）不过这是我打算以后再谈的一个事情了。
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="h2">Chivalry
                <div class="ch">骑士精神</div>
            </div>
            <div class="p">Before I do, I'd like to put forward a theory that (I think) plays an important role in the
                way a lot of the original dancers showed off. Despite the fact that a majority of the old timer leaders
                around today are “dirty old men,” who would make a sexist/racist/anti-Commie/pornographic comment by the
                end of two shots of George Dickel, almost all of them still grew up with an idea of chivalry that is
                different than what we have today.
                This is due partly to the fact they were a lot closer to the Victorian era than we are (And don't get me
                wrong-chivalry, to this writer, is good human decency). But it is also probably due to the fact that
                chivalry, to a male teenager, is a great way of impressing women, an old-fashioned way of showing off.
                <div class="ch">
                    首先，我想提出一个（我觉得）在老舞者们“炫耀”方式中起到关键作用的理论。尽管大部分旧时代leader放在今天都是“龌龊老男人”
                    ——那种喝了两轮George Dickel（译者注：一种威士忌）就开始讲一些大男子主义/种族主义/反共产主义/色情言论，几乎他们中
                    的所有人都伴着骑士精神长大，这和我们现在不同。
                    这一部分是因为他们确实生活在距离维多利亚时代更近的时期（另外不要误会我，骑士精神对笔者来说是种很好的人道精神）。但也是
                    因为事实上骑士精神对男青年们是一种很好的让女孩子们印象深刻的手段，一种古老的“炫耀”方式。
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="p">And I think this chivalry extended into their dance: To the old timers, it was very important
                to be a good person to dance with.
                And showing off that you were a good person to dance with didn't just mean you could dance well
                and lead challenging steps, like it tends to do today. If you were that teenager we were talking about
                (Ah, yes, the teenager), you paid attention to your partner, you kept him/her from getting kicked around
                on the floor, and you'd be right there with them through the tricky moves. (For instance, Frankie
                Manning <em>always</em> taught, “Bow to your queen.”) To top it off, you'd show off your partner to
                everyone else on the dance floor.<sup>5</sup>
                <div class="ch">
                    并且我认为骑士精神延伸到了他们的舞蹈：对老舞者而言，做一个好的舞伴是一件很重要的事情。而展示自己是个好的舞伴不仅仅意味着
                    你跳的很好而且能带出来一些有挑战性的动作——就像现在貌似很多人认为的一样。如果你是我们正在讨论的那个青少年（是的没错，青少年），
                    你会关注你的舞伴，保护他/她在舞池里不被踢到，并且做那些很复杂的动作时永远和舞伴在一起。（举个栗子，Frankie Manning<em>总是</em>教导的，“向你的女王鞠躬。”）
                    再高级点的要求，你要把你的舞伴展示给舞池中的每一个人。

            <div class="p">As further evidence for this chivalry, I'll use this anecdote: Sylvia Sykes likes having the
                original Pure Balboa dancer Dean Raferty judge leads in modern Balboa Jack and Jills, because he always
                marks down heavily for leaders who don't pay attention to their followers.
                Some of the “hot shot” leads in these contest won't even get passed through to finals by him-a score
                they should pay attention to.
                As evidence to the fact that this chivalry is often a double-standard, Sylvia doesn't like many old
                timer leaders to judge followers because they'll just choose the girl with the best legs.
                <div class="ch">
                    接下来我想讲一个轶事来证明这种骑士精神的存在：Sylvia Sykes喜欢请根源Pure-Bal舞者Dean Raferty做当代Balboa随机搭档
                    比赛的leader评委，因为他总是会把那些不关注自己fo的leader刷下来。这些比赛里有一些“热门”leader甚至不能从他这里闯入决赛——一个他们应该关注的目标。
                    实际上这种骑士精神经常是双标的，Sylvia不喜欢请根源leader舞者去评判follower，因为他们只会选腿最好看的女孩子。
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="p">I know what you're saying-the old timers muscled their women around, and in many clips, the
                leaders are just
                holding onto their followers to show off (Perhaps they will use Leon James, in his spirit moves slide
                jam, to
                prove the point-his jam is 3:03-3:30 in this clip.)
                <div class="ch">
                    我知道你想说什么： 老舞者们在很多老片段里把他们的女人甩来甩去的，leader们只是抱着他们的follower四处“炫耀”
                    （或许你们会举Leon Jaoms在spirit moves里jam那段来证明这个说法，所提及的表演在下面这个视频的 3:03-3:30 ）
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="p"><span class="embed-youtube"

            </div>
            <div class="p">But I believe this peacock jam actually proves my point nicely. First off, yes, this is a jam
                where Leon James
                shows off (in the “Sausage Fest” section of the Spirit Moves-which I must admit I could happily watch
                for hours)
                and takes almost all of the attention away from his follower. (But she does have plenty of space in the
                movements to dance and show off her own styling). But, more importantly, if you watch this clip and
                imagine an
                average modern couple doing the exact same jam, what would be out of place? I think it'd be rare to see
                3:25-3:33 in a modern jam-a moment where both leader and follower are simply smiling and laughing with
                each
                other. Leon James IS paying attention to his partner, he even stops all of his peacocking and breaks
                down for a
                moment to share a laugh with her.
                <div class="ch">
                    但是我相信这场炫技jam实际上很好的证明了我的观点。首先，确实，这个jam确实时Leon James的一场“炫耀”（Spirit Moves中着重展示男舞者的
                    一个章节——不得不说我很乐意花好几个小时反复观看），并且风头几乎完全盖住了follower（但是她也是有相当的空间去“炫耀”自己的）。但是更重要
                    的是如果你想象这段jam是一对平常的现代舞者跳的，会看起来怎么样呢？我觉得你应该不大可能看到像3:25-3:33那样的片段——leader和follower只是
                    简单的对着彼此大笑。Leon James<strong>是有在关注自己的舞伴的</strong>，他甚至因为和对方一起开怀大笑暂时停止了炫技。

            <div class="h2">Competition
                <div class="ch">比赛</div>
            </div>
            <div class="p">Now that we have added a little chivalry to the mix, let's look at that teenager (what
                teenager?) in the other part of their dance life: competitions.
                A dancer in the swing era might have done contests all the time, especially if they were a California
                dancer.
                The California kids we see in the films made a lot of their spending money by winning contests, which
                I've heard some old timers say happened practically every night.
                Also, the California kids had access to Hollywood, and the opportunity to dance in a lot of films if
                they were good enough.
                Thus, showing off became an entertainment art.
                I believe a lot of partners began working more as stage performers than social dancers-an important
                distinction to make.
                <div class="ch">
                    现在我们在“配方”里加了一点骑士精神，再来看看这个青少年（谁？）舞生的另一个部分：比赛。
                    一个摇摆年代的舞者，特别是加州舞者，可能一直都在比赛。
                    电影里，加州的孩子们通过赢得比赛赚了不少零花钱，听老舞者们说这种事情几乎每晚都发生。并且，加州的孩子们接触的到好莱坞，
                    只要他们足够优秀，就有机会在很多电影里跳舞。因此，“炫耀”成了一门娱乐艺术。我相信很多搭档开始作为舞台表演者而不是社交舞者
                    去跳舞——两者有很大差别。

            </div>
            <div class="p">As far as early Lindy Hop, Balboa, and Collegiate Shag footage goes, we have almost nothing
                of social dancing, let alone social dancing to the actual music the dancer's are dancing to.
                Almost everything we see in the original footage is someone who knows there is a camera right there,
                which we all know affects the way people dance.
                But, retracing my argument from an earlier footnote, I think we can still get an idea for the spirit of
                the original jitterbuggers even though we're not seeing them in their natural social-dancing habitat, at
                least.
                <div class="ch">
                    尽管早期Lindy Hop，Balboa，Collegiate Shag的录像不断涌现，我们却几乎很少看到真正的跟着原本音乐且不受打扰的即兴舞蹈。
                    几乎所有的老录像中舞者们都是知道摄影机的存在的——我们知道这会影响到舞者跳舞的方式。
                    但是，重说回我在前面的注解里提到的论证，尽管我们没有在自然的社交环境下看到他们的社交舞，我觉得我们依然可以从中提炼出
                    根源精神。

            <div class="p">
                Modern day dancers are different people in a different world, dancing for possibly different reasons.
                I started off dancing not only because I was drawn to it like a moth to the flame, but because I
                realized I was a theater dork who had no idea how to talk to a girl I wasn't in a play with.
                For many others, they're the math and science types who realize that the world of meet-and-greet bars is
                a needlessly awkward method of socializing.
                And for almost all of us, it's a love for something in the past-something we have at least some level of
                nostalgic passion for.
                I think it's interesting that for us, we're enjoying a historical hobby, but for them, it was a popular,
                contemporary hobby.
                I don't think it's very important, just interesting.
                I think the fact we all, original and modern dancers, love the music so much, is far more uniting than
                such a difference in point-of-view would be dividing.
                <div class="ch">
                    现代的舞者们来自各种各样的地方，跳舞的目的也各不相同。我最开始跳舞一方面是因为我确实被这种舞吸引到了，另一方面是因为
                    我意识到我是个完全不知道该怎么和戏外女孩子搭讪的“戏呆子”。
                    也有很多其他人，是那种“书呆子”——他们觉得在酒吧里和人自来熟是完全不必要的尴尬社交。
                    对我们中的大部分人来说，这是一种对复古事物——某种程度上激发了我们怀旧冲动的事物——的喜爱。
                    这很有趣：对我们来说，我们是在享受一种有历史意义的爱好，而对他们来说，那是一种当代流行爱好。
                    这倒不是很重要，我只是觉得很有趣。
                    我想我们——当代舞者和根源舞者——对音乐的热爱是超越了历史视角隔阂的。

            </div>
            <div class="p">
                The idea that “showing off” is a part of the original spirit of the jitterbug might be hard for some
                modern people to latch onto.
                After all, a lot of us modern dancers are simply looking for a fun time, good exercise, and a chance to
                enjoy great music.
                Is there anything wrong with this? Of course not.
                I even think such an idea is very much in the spirit of most of the people you'd see on the dance floor
                in the 1930s.
                So perhaps I should clarify-I believe that showing off is an important aspect of the swing dance
                <em>artist</em>, which makes obvious sense, as we are the only canvas our art can be displayed on.
                <div class="ch">
                    “炫耀”是根源精神的一部分这个想法对很多现代人来说可能有点难以接受。毕竟，大部分现代舞者跳舞只是为了开心一下，运动一下，听听好的音乐。
                    这有错么？当然没有。
                    我甚至觉得这种想法也是1930年代舞池里大部分人的想法。
                    所以我可能有必要明确说明一下：我相信“炫耀”是摇摆舞<strong><em>艺术</em></strong>的重要组成部分——也很容易理解，毕竟这项艺术的唯一“画布”就是我们自己。

            <div class="p">
                In discussing this essay, my partner Kate pointed out something that struck home.
                If you look at a lot of advanced swing dance competitors today, they seem to compete for the end
                product, rather than the means to that product.
                They dance to be thought of as a badass, to get the recognition.
                There dancing asks “Will this get people thinking highly of me?” rather than says something like, “This
                is who I am,” or “I'm really loving this song,”
                or even “Check out this great move I'm really excited about.” which is, as we mentioned, an important
                component to the way the Old Timers showed off. <sup>6</sup>
                <div class="ch">
                    在讨论本节内容的时候，我的搭档Kate指出了一些正中要害的问题。
                    看看现代的比赛选手们，你会发现，他们比赛比的结果而不是过程。
                    他们跳舞是为了让别人觉得自己牛逼，为了获得认可。
                    他们的舞蹈仿佛在问：“这会让人们给出高度评价么？”而不是说：“这就是我”或者“我真心喜欢这首歌”，再或者哪怕是：“看看这个我特别喜欢的动作。”
                    ——而这，正如我们前面提到的，是根源舞者们“炫耀”方式的重要组成部分。<sup>6</sup>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="p">Perhaps an important aspect of this is that almost all chances for a modern day swing dancer
                to show off is a contest, with clear placements of who won or not.
                The jam circle, however, was a way for dancers to show off, with the only contest and placements being
                in the imagination of those taking part or watching.
                One could argue it's only a small difference, but I think an important one.
                I think Jam Circles, without a clear winner, helped foster showing off a dancer's individuality.
                And of course, having frequent jam circles helped make the original dancers very good at showing off.
                In my partner Kate's early days (2002-ish), they had a jam circle every week.
                To prepare, Kate and her partner would learn new steps to show off each week, and I imagine a lot of
                early swing dancers doing the same thing, in terms of practicing to show off their stuff.
                <div class="ch">
                    或者造成这种局面的一个很重要的原因是现代摇摆舞者们几乎也只能在胜负分明的比赛中“炫耀”自己了。
                    然而jam circle曾经是舞者们仅有的比赛，而比赛的结果全凭现场观众和选手自己猜。
                    有人会说，两者差别不大，但我觉得这点细微差别产生了巨大影响。
                    我认为没有明确胜者的jam circle滋养了舞者对于自身个性的“炫耀”。当然，频繁的jam circle也使得根源舞者们十分擅长“炫耀”。
                    在我的搭档Kate最开始跳舞的时候（2002之后的一段时间里），他们每周都会有jam circle。Kate和她的搭档也会每周提前准备
                    新的步子，我猜测很多早期摇摆舞者在练习“炫耀”自己的招式时做过同样的事情。

            <div class="p">Spontaneous jam circles don't happen much these days.
                They made a brief rebirth for a few years in certain cities and events, but I can only recall three or
                four I saw last year, and almost all of those were weekend events.
                So, like <em>Fight Club</em>, where Tyler Durden gives everyone homework to go out and start a fight,
                I'd like to push all of you readers to go out this month and start a jam circle.
                (1) Wait for a relatively uptempo song (2) Grab two friends (3) surround a couple that's doing well, (4)
                start clapping and yell when they do something inspiring (this simple Pavlovian Conditioning will get
                them to try to one-up themselves) (5) Make it a point for all three of you to stay their clapping until
                the end of the song.
                Even if a Jam Circle doesn't grow, imagine the exhilaration for that one couple to have their own
                personal jam circle.
                Or, they may just be scared. But it will be a start.
                <div class="ch">
                    现在自发的jam circle很少发生了。有那么几年jam circle在一些城市和活动中重新浮现过，但是去年我也就看到差不多三、四次，
                    而且基本都是些周末小活动。
                    所以，就像《搏击俱乐部》里Tyler Durden给每个人布置作业出去打一架那样，我想呼吁下各位读者，这个月去发起一场jam circle。
                    （1）蹲一首稍微快一点的歌。
                    （2）拉上两个朋友。
                    （3）包围一对儿跳的比较好的。
                    （4）当他们做出一些很有启发性的东西时，鼓掌呐喊！——这种简单的巴甫洛夫条件反射会使他们想要努力战胜自己。
                    （译者注：巴甫洛夫反射，也称经典条件反射，是指一个刺激和另一个带有奖赏或惩罚的无条件刺激多次联结，可使个体学会在单独呈现该一刺激时，也能引发类似无条件反应的条件反应。）
                    （5）你们三个一定要一直站在那里拍手维持这个circle，直到音乐结束。即使没有跟多人加入jam circle，想象一下那对儿拥有了私人jam circle的人该有多高兴。
                    也有可能他们只会被吓一跳。不过这依然是个开始。
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="p">Now, all of this said, here is something I think is very important to modern day dancing:
                You don't have to be incredibly good at showing off to make a living teaching swing.
                Because, though showing off might bring an entertainment and inspirational element to the dance, it has
                almost no direct effect on teaching the dance.
                For that, you need a good teacher who understands the mechanics of the dance an can convey those ideas
                to groups in affective ways (and rotate enough to keep people from getting angry).
                I think many people tend to combine tightly the idea that a good competitor and a good teacher are one.
                They do sometimes come in package deals, but do know there are some incredible performers who teach very
                poorly, and there are some incredible teachers who simply don't do their best dancing in front of
                audiences.
                But if we realize this, we can have the best of both worlds-performers to inspire us, teachers to guide
                us.
                <div class="ch">
                    到此，我们的论述来到了一个我觉得对当代摇摆舞很重要的点：作为一个教课的老师，你不需要超级擅长“炫耀”。因为尽管“炫耀”会
                    给舞蹈带来很多快乐和灵感，但基本不会直接影响到教课。如果是为了教课，你需要的是一个能很好的把跳舞的物理原理有效传达给社群（并且擅长调解气氛避免矛盾）的老师。
                    我觉得很多人倾向于认为一个好的老师必然也是一个好的选手。有些老师确实能做到这样，但要意识到，有相当一部分顶尖表演者教课真的很烂，也有一些顶尖的老师真的没办法
                    在一群观众面前发挥到最好。但是当我们意识到这个现实，我们就可以各取所长——让好的表演者启发我们，让好的老师指导我们。

                1. Benny Goodman's 1935 concert at the Palamar was the first instance of the kind of energy teens in
                mass would later put towards Elvis and the Beatles.
                <div class="ch">
                    1. Benny Goodman 1935年在Palamar的音乐会盛况就是第一个例子来揭示当时的青少年们是怎样的狂热——这种狂热后来转向了猫王和
                    披头士。

            <div class="p">2.I recently did an in-depth interview with Jonathan Stout where he goes into pretty
                descriptive detail about how he gears everything his band does towards dancers. Look for it on Swungover
                soon.
                <div class="ch">
                    2. 最近我和Jonathan Stout做了个深度访谈，他详细描绘了他的乐队是怎样去配合舞者的。期待Swungover的后续文章吧。
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="p">3.One could argue there's a bit of a logical circle here:
                I theorize showing off is a part of the original spirit of the jitterbugs;
                based on the evidence that I've seen it in most of the old clips and read about it in autobiographies of
                great dancers-clips which were taped for the purpose of showing off the dance, and great dancers who
                were made great by their ability to show off.
                See the problem? There could have been many more average dancers who never showed off that we don't see
                because they were never special enough dancers to be put in a clip or to write a book about their life.
                So, if we looked onto a dance floor of the 1930s, it might not stick out that showing off was
                necessarily a part of the spirit of the jitterbugs.
                <div class="ch">
                    3. 这里其实有个有点争议的环形逻辑：我提出“炫耀”是根源精神的一部分，依据是我看到的很多老录影片段和读到的很多伟大舞者
                    的自传，这些老录影片段是以展示（“炫耀”）这个舞蹈为目的拍摄的，这些伟大舞者是因其卓越的“炫耀”才能而伟大的。
                    发现问题了么？可能有大量的不“炫耀”的平凡舞者因为他们不够特别不会出现在录像里，也不会有自己的自传。所以如果我们去看
                    1930年代舞池里的实际情况，“炫耀”是根源精神的一部分这样的观点可能就不是那么呼之欲出了。
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="p">But to me, this problem isn't really an important one.
                That's because being a performer, entertaining people (if only yourself), exploring one's creativity,
                and making athletic demands on your body all seem to match perfectly the swing music that is being
                danced to. Swing music, filled with musicians showing off their solos, and bands showing how hard they
                can swing. It is in this sense I believe it is part of the spirit of the original
                Jitterbuggers. One might argue that Pure Balboa is an exception, which I mention later in the footnotes.
                <div class="ch">
                    但是于我而言，这个漏洞不是很严重。因为作为一个表演者，为了取悦观众（而不仅仅是自己），开发创造力，强健体魄，就需要
                    你的身体和正在跳的摇摆乐高度匹配。摇摆乐中充斥着音乐家的炫技solo以及乐队对自己能有多摇摆的竭力展示。从这种意义上来讲，
                    我相信“炫耀”是根源精神的一部分。另一个可能引起争议的点是有人会说Pure-balboa不是这样的，我会在之后的注解里提及这个问题。
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="p">Being an actor and ham, I'm fine with showing off being a part of the dance. I've recently
                taken a long, deep inward look at myself and realized I should be a lot better at it, considering who I
                was as a young boy.
                If he saw me today, my twelve-year-old self would say “What's your problem? Why aren't you hogging all
                the attention in the room?”
                I think one reason I (and other dancers) choke a lot in modern competitions is because (as
                mentioned in the essay text) we're not used to focusing on one-upping each other. We're not used to
                allowing that competitive drive and confidence to take over at the very moment it needs to.
                The pressure which is crushed so easily by confidence becomes an impenetrable fortress with the lack of
                it.
                I think it's one reason why so many So-Cal dancers handle competitions well-the one-upness attitude and
                showing-off confidence has been an important part of their scene ever since the neo-swing craze and
                before.
                <div class="ch">
                    作为一个蹩脚男演员，我是可以接受舞蹈中有“炫耀”成分的。我最近很深刻的自我审视了一下，我意识到如果我再年轻点会更擅长“炫耀”。
                    如果十二岁的我看到我现在的样子，估计会说：“你怎么回事？为什么不成为全场唯一的焦点？”
                    我想我和其他一些舞者一比赛就卡住，是因为我们不习惯与争抢风头（就像我正文中说的那样）。我们不习惯让竞争性的驱动力和自信心
                    在他们本应主导我们的时候自然的发生。
                    本应很容易被自信冲破的压力，却因为自信的匮乏，成为了难以突破的壁垒。
                    我想这也是为什么那么多so-cal的舞者们在比赛中游刃有余——抢风头和“炫耀”的自信早在摇摆复兴甚至更早的时候就已经是他们
                    那个圈子的重要组成部分。（译者注：摇摆复兴，The swing revival, 也称为 retro swing 和 neo-swing,
                    是指从1989年开始在90年代早期和中期达到高潮的摇摆乐回潮现象。）
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="p">4. It's like the rare-but-very-powerful Lennon/McCartney syndrome. John Lennon and Paul
                McCartney were talented in their own right, but always inspired and pushed each other to write better
                and better songs, in what was an incredibly productive competitive environment.
                To demonstrate, I will now get Hey Jude stuck in your head. Naa-na-na-nananaaaaaaa….
                <div class="ch">
                    4. 这就像罕见但强力的列侬-麦卡特尼综合征。约翰列侬和保罗·麦卡特尼各具天赋，但经常启发和激励彼此创作出一首比一首好的作品，这就是一种
                    极具正面成效的竞争环境。为了演示这种现象，我要开始在我脑子里哼Hey Jude了。Naa-na-na-nananaaaaaaa…
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="p">5. This is where I'd like to mention Pure Balboa briefly. Pure Balboa was a chest-to-chest
                dance developed on packed dance floors.
                If swing music is a relaxed explosion of energy, then Pure Balboa dancers emphasize the relaxed part of
                it more than the explosion part.
                It was a dance done mainly by sweethearts, and on a packed dance floor where people aren't going to see
                many steps.
                So, showing off becomes a lot more partner-focused, and more internal.
                What a Pure Balboa dancer shows off in leading/following and creativity is smoothness, finesse, subtly.
                Not having video of the original Pure Balboa dancers, I can't say for sure whether it looked
                like showing off was part of their dance.
                But I believe it was still there, again, almost part of the music.
                <div class="ch">
                    5. 我要在这里简要提及下Pure-bal。Pure-bal是一种在拥挤的舞池里胸贴胸跳的舞蹈。如果摇摆乐是在轻松中爆发能量，那Pure-bal舞者
                    更强调的就是轻松而不是爆发。这是一种主要是情人间跳的舞，并且在拥挤的舞池里你也看不到多少脚步。所以此时“炫耀”变得
                    更针对自己的舞伴，也更内敛。Pure-bal舞者在领舞、跟舞、创造性上“炫耀”的主要是丝滑感、巧妙感、精细感。没看过Pure-bal
                    舞者们的原始录像，我也不能很确定的说“炫耀”是不是他们舞蹈中很重要的部分。但是我相信“炫耀”依旧是在的——还是因为音乐的原因。
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="p">6. Partially to blame is the fact is that competition in modern Lindy Hop has the hope of
                actually leading someplace-whereas to the original dancers, swing dancing was just a beloved hobby.
                An original dancer wasn't going to teach the dance and make hundreds, like today. A 1930s Jitterbug
                wasn't going to have admiration and recognition beyond his ballroom peers, other than simply being a
                stage performer with a novelty act.
                The other factor is that people try to break down the “rules” of winnign based on what they see win, and
                so start to structure their dancing around winning contests.
                Though it's good to explore the performance aspect of contests, this idea of competitors gearing their
                dancing to win all to easily becomes a Frankenstein that takes over a dancers chance at honest
                self-expression if not kept in check. 
                <div class="ch">
                    6. 一定程度上可以去怪罪的，就是现代Lindy Hop比赛是有建立行业标杆目的的，而对根源舞者来说，摇摆舞只是他们热爱的爱好。
                    一个根源舞者是不会像今天这样通过教课来赚很多钱的。一个1930年代的舞者不会在舞厅同僚之外获得太多的认可和钦佩，充其量也就是
                    获得一个在新戏里表演的机会。
                    另一个因素是人们尝试通过他们看到的去分析和拆解胜利的“规则”，然后开始围绕这套规则去构建自己的舞蹈。
                    尽管从表演层面去探索比赛是一件好事，如果不时刻保持警惕，选手们很容易被为了轻易取胜而让自己的舞蹈适配胜利“规则”这样的想法反噬，
                    最终丧失了诚实的自我表达的机会。
