            <div class="p">The great depression caused such a stifling melancholy on the country, it actually makes
                sense that people would
                spend money they couldn't afford to go out and hear great jazz and forget their troubles. For
                mild-mannered
                teenagers in America, the explosion of swing music expressed an excitement that sharply contrasted the
                boring,
                sugar-sweet music their parents listened to, and we all know how important music is to teenage
                culture.<sup>1</sup>
                Swing
                music and swing rhythm itself can be characterized by its paradoxically relaxed but driving release of
                energy.
                <div class="ch">
                    经济大萧条使整个国家都淹没在令人窒息的忧伤中，这实际上说通了为什么那时人们愿意花他们实际上负担不起的钱去听爵士乐以忘却烦恼。
                    对于一向温文尔雅的美国青少年来说，摇摆乐的大爆发表达了一种和父辈听的无聊的小甜曲对比鲜明的兴奋感，我们也都明白音乐在青少年文化中有多重要。
                    摇摆乐和摇摆节奏的一大标志性特点就是轻松却饱含能量。
                    （译者注：摇摆乐自身的矛盾感和新一代青少年与父辈间的审美矛盾形成了有趣的对照？）
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="p">An original swing dancer probably released a great deal of their pent-up physical, emotional,
                and social energy through a night of dancing.
                Think about it: A modern person can do a million things to
                entertain
                themselves
                physically and emotionally. In the 1930s, and during the great depression, even a person who lived in
                the city had much more limited options. For most average Americans, movies, dancing, or drinking at a
                bar were probably the main desires as far as leaving the house, (which, come to think of it, is not very
                different from several of my friends). And only one of those was a place where a teenager could meet
                other people and socialize.
                Aside from the malt shop, it's where teenagers met up before the age of arcades, malls, concerts, and
                cocaine orgies.
                And even malt shops had records and dancing. It's also not surprising because, as we all know, swing
                dancing is fun as hell.
                <div class="ch">
                    根源舞者跳舞的一晚释放了相当多平时无处释放的能量——生理性的，情绪性的，社交性的。 思考一下：一个现代人，有千千万万的方式去取悦自己的身体和精神。
                    在30年代，大萧条期间，即使是生活在城市里的人也选择有限。对于大多数美国老百姓，电影，跳舞，去酒吧喝酒是出门后
                    主要想干的几件事（仔细想一下，我的几个朋友也差不多就是这样）。这其中只有一个地方允许青少年和其他人见面社交。
                    在够年龄去街机厅、商场、音乐会、可卡因聚会前，青少年一般约在甜品店旁见面。而即使甜品店也可以听歌跳舞。也没什么好
                    惊讶的，我们也都知道，摇摆舞好玩的要死。
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="p">Let's take a California teenager, or even a person living near the Savoy, like a young
                Frankie Manning or Norma
                Miller. That person could easily dance almost every night of the week, to incredible live, big bands
                whose sole
                (and soul) purpose was playing for dancers. (A much-more-complicated-than-you-would-think art, and a
                lost one,
                with the exception of a handful of modern bands).<sup>2</sup>
                <div class="ch">
                    具体一点，我们来看一下一个加州青少年，或者随便一个生活在Savoy的人——比如年轻的Frankie Manning或者Norma Miller。
                    这么个人可以很轻易的跟着绝佳的，唯一目的（或者终极追求）就是为舞者演奏的现场大乐队每天都跳舞。（大乐队，一种或许比你
                    想象的复杂得多的艺术形式，一种遗失的技艺——当代大乐队，用手都数的过来。）
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="p">Anyway, that teenager that could dance five nights a week was, like most teenagers, probably
                interested in gaining acceptance with their peers and dates with members of the opposite sex.
                This means, realistically, a good portion of their dance energy was probably spent towards impressing
                their partner or competing with (friendly or not friendly) rivals.
                Or, take Frankie and Norma, who had to constantly one-up dancers like Shorty Snowden to get recognition.
                Anyway you look at it, showing off was a part of the spirit of the original
                jitterbugs.<sup>3</sup> For instance, can you name any other partner dance where it's common practice to have
                people all
                of a sudden start clapping around another couple and then have people take turns exhibiting their dance?
                The
                fact that Jam Circles were a part of jazz dance beautifully illustrates this spirit.
                <div class="ch">
                    总之，这么个一周可以跳5天年轻人可能主要是想赢得同龄人的认可然后和异性约会——就像大多数青少年那样。这就意味着实际上
                    相当一部分他们跳舞的能量估计是为了让自己的舞伴印象深刻，或者和自己的对手竞争（友善得、不友善得）。
                    或者，就拿Frankie和Norma来讲，需要不断的战胜如Shorty Snowden这样的舞者来获得认可。
                    反正你仔细观察就能发现，炫耀是根源精神的一部分。具体的证据就是，你能说得出任何一个其他双人舞会习惯于一群人突然开始
                    围着一对舞者鼓掌然后大家轮流上去竭尽所能跳舞么？Jam Circles是爵士舞中的一部分这个事实就是对这种精神的绝好展示。
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="p">And I don't think it's a bad thing. A lot of us who grew up in the 90s, were taught, often
                subconsciously, that being a competitive person is at root a bad thing;
                that putting focus on one-upping someone else is contradictory to the more kindly spirit of simply
                trying your best and enjoying what you're doing.
                The old dancers, if they thought about it at all, didn't think the two ideas were contradictory.
                I believe almost all tried their best and enjoyed what they were doing, part of which was the game of
                trying to one-up their friends and rivals.
                It's a pretty easy impression to get from talking to old timers, or by reading Norma Miller's Book,
                the Savoy Section of Marshall Stearns's <em>Jazz Dance</em>, and Frankie Manning's autobiography.
                It's a form of competition that, if fostered in a healthy way, can lead to incredibly inspiring dancing.
                ****</div>
            <div class="p">It helps to clarify that (1) “showing off” has a modern negative connotation implying a vain
                act, and though I do
                think vanity probably creeps into it somewhere for a lot of people, I don't believe it's a necessary
                part of it
                and I'd prefer for people to look on it more as a neutral term for “displaying their skills” and (2)
                there are
                different ways to show off. </div>
            <div class="p">Of course, the modern dance scene, especially a lot of competitors, don't seem to have much
                of a problem with
                wanting to show off. But I think there are several important problems with the way many of the modern
                dancers
                choose to show off . (For instance, I think it's easy for many competitors to choose the form of showing
                off
                where you say “Here's what I can do, can you do it?”, whereas a more difficult, and more artistic, way
                to show
                off is “This is who I am, who are you?” That's what I see so clearly when I see Al and Leon dance next
                to each
                other. Of course, an up-and-coming swing modern competitor should not be expected to have reached the
                level of
                self-expression of veterans like Al and Leon.) But that's something we'll talk about later.</div>
            <div class="h2">Chivalry</div>
            <div class="p">Before I do, I'd like to put forward a theory that (I think) plays an important role in the
                way a lot of the
                original dancers showed off. Despite the fact that a majority of the old timer leaders around today are
                “dirty
                old men,” who would make a sexist/racist/anti-Commie/pornographic comment by the end of two shots of
                George
                Dickel, almost all of them still grew up with an idea of chivalry that is different than what we have
                today.
                This is due partly to the fact they were a lot closer to the Victorian era than we are (And don't get me
                wrong-chivalry, to this writer, is good human decency). But it is also probably due to the fact that
                chivalry,
                to a male teenager, is a great way of impressing women, an old-fashioned way of showing off. </div>
            <div class="p">And I think this chivalry extended into their dance: To the old timers, it was very important
                to be a good person
                to dance with. And showing off that you were a good person to dance with didn't just mean you could
                dance well
                and lead challenging steps, like it tends to do today. If you were that teenager we were talking about
                (Ah, yes,
                the teenager), you paid attention to your partner, you kept him/her from getting kicked around on the
                floor, and
                you'd be right there with them through the tricky moves. (For instance, Frankie Manning <em>always</em>
                taught,
                “Bow to your queen.”) To top it off, you'd show off your partner to everyone else on the dance floor.
                ***** </div>
            <div class="p">As further evidence for this chivalry, I'll use this anecdote: Sylvia Sykes likes having the
                original Pure Balboa
                dancer Dean Raferty judge leads in modern Balboa Jack and Jills, because he always marks down heavily
                for
                leaders who don't pay attention to their followers. Some of the “hot shot” leads in these contest won't
                even get
                passed through to finals by him-a score they should pay attention to. As evidence to the fact that this
                chivalry
                is often a double-standard, Sylvia doesn't like many old timer leaders to judge followers because
                they'll just
                choose the girl with the best legs. </div>
            <div class="p">I know what you're saying-the old timers muscled their women around, and in many clips, the
                leaders are just
                holding onto their followers to show off (Perhaps they will use Leon James, in his spirit moves slide
                jam, to
                prove the point-his jam is 3:03-3:30 in this clip.) </div>
            <div class="p"><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe
                        class="youtube-player" width="600" height="338"
                        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ByEzObz2BDw?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent"

                        sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></span></div>
            <div class="p">But I believe this peacock jam actually proves my point nicely. First off, yes, this is a jam
                where Leon James
                shows off (in the “Sausage Fest” section of the Spirit Moves-which I must admit I could happily watch
                for hours)
                and takes almost all of the attention away from his follower. (But she does have plenty of space in the
                movements to dance and show off her own styling). But, more importantly, if you watch this clip and
                imagine an
                average modern couple doing the exact same jam, what would be out of place? I think it'd be rare to see
                3:25-3:33 in a modern jam-a moment where both leader and follower are simply smiling and laughing with
                each
                other. Leon James IS paying attention to his partner, he even stops all of his peacocking and breaks
                down for a
                moment to share a laugh with her. </div>
            <div class="h2">Competition</div>
            <div class="p">Now that we have added a little chivalry to the mix, let's look at that teenager (what
                teenager?) in the other
                part of their dance life: competitions. A dancer in the swing era might have done contests all the time,
                especially if they were a California dancer. The California kids we see in the films made a lot of their
                spending money by winning contests, which I've heard some old timers say happened practically every
                night. Also,
                the California kids had access to Hollywood, and the opportunity to dance in a lot of films if they were
                good
                enough. Thus, showing off became an entertainment art. I believe a lot of partners began working more as
                stage
                performers than social dancers-an important distinction to make. </div>
            <div class="p">As far as early Lindy Hop, Balboa, and Collegiate Shag footage goes, we have almost nothing
                of social dancing,
                let alone social dancing to the actual music the dancer's are dancing to. Almost everything we see in
                the
                original footage is someone who knows there is a camera right there, which we all know affects the way
                people
                dance. But, retracing my argument from an earlier footnote, I think we can still get an idea for the
                spirit of
                the original jitterbuggers even though we're not seeing them in their natural social-dancing habitat, at
                least.
            </div>
            <div class="p">Modern day dancers are different people in a different world, dancing for possibly different
                reasons. I started
                off dancing not only because I was drawn to it like a moth to the flame, but because I realized I was a
                theater
                dork who had no idea how to talk to a girl I wasn't in a play with. For many others, they're the math
                and
                science types who realize that the world of meet-and-greet bars is a needlessly awkward method of
                socializing.
                And for almost all of us, it's a love for something in the past-something we have at least some level of
                nostalgic passion for. I think it's interesting that for us, we're enjoying a historical hobby, but for
                them, it
                was a popular, contemporary hobby. I don't think it's very important, just interesting. I think the fact
                we all,
                original and modern dancers, love the music so much, is far more uniting than such a difference in
                point-of-view
                would be dividing.</div>
            <div class="p">The idea that “showing off” is a part of the original spirit of the jitterbug might be hard
                for some modern
                people to latch onto. After all, a lot of us modern dancers are simply looking for a fun time, good
                exercise,
                and a chance to enjoy great music. Is there anything wrong with this? Of course not. I even think such
                an idea
                is very much in the spirit of most of the people you'd see on the dance floor in the 1930s. So perhaps I
                should
                clarify-I believe that showing off is an important aspect of the swing dance <em>artist</em>, which
                makes
                obvious sense, as we are the only canvas our art can be displayed on. </div>
            <div class="p">In discussing this essay, my partner Kate pointed out something that struck home. If you look
                at a lot of
                advanced swing dance competitors today, they seem to compete for the end product, rather than the means
                to that
                product. They dance to be thought of as a badass, to get the recognition. There dancing asks “Will this
                get
                people thinking highly of me?” rather than says something like, “This is who I am,” or “I'm really
                loving this
                song,” or even “Check out this great move I'm really excited about.” which is, as we mentioned, an
                important
                component to the way the Old Timers showed off. ******</div>
            <div class="p">Perhaps an important aspect of this is that almost all chances for a modern day swing dancer
                to show off is a
                contest, with clear placements of who won or not. The jam circle, however, was a way for dancers to show
                off,
                with the only contest and placements being in the imagination of those taking part or watching. One
                could argue
                it's only a small difference, but I think an important one. I think Jam Circles, without a clear winner,
                helped
                foster showing off a dancer's individuality. And of course, having frequent jam circles helped make the
                original
                dancers very good at showing off. In my partner Kate's early days (2002-ish), they had a jam circle
                every week.
                To prepare, Kate and her partner would learn new steps to show off each week, and I imagine a lot of
                early swing
                dancers doing the same thing, in terms of practicing to show off their stuff. </div>
            <div class="p">Spontaneous jam circles don't happen much these days. They made a brief rebirth for a few
                years in certain cities
                and events, but I can only recall three or four I saw last year, and almost all of those were weekend
                events.
                So, like <em>Fight Club</em>, where Tyler Durden gives everyone homework to go out and start a fight,
                I'd like
                to push all of you readers to go out this month and start a jam circle. (1) Wait for a relatively
                uptempo song
                (2) Grab two friends (3) surround a couple that's doing well, (4) start clapping and yell when they do
                something
                inspiring (this simple Pavlovian Conditioning will get them to try to one-up themselves) (5) Make it a
                point for
                all three of you to stay their clapping until the end of the song. Even if a Jam Circle doesn't grow,
                imagine
                the exhilaration for that one couple to have their own personal jam circle. Or, they may just be scared.
                But it
                will be a start. </div>
            <div class="p">Now, all of this said, here is something I think is very important to modern day dancing: You
                don't have to be
                incredibly good at showing off to make a living teaching swing. Because, though showing off might bring
                an
                entertainment and inspirational element to the dance, it has almost no direct effect on teaching the
                dance. For
                that, you need a good teacher who understands the mechanics of the dance an can convey those ideas to
                groups in
                affective ways (and rotate enough to keep people from getting angry). I think many people tend to
                combine
                tightly the idea that a good competitor and a good teacher are one. They do sometimes come in package
                deals, but
                do know there are some incredible performers who teach very poorly, and there are some incredible
                teachers who
                simply don't do their best dancing in front of audiences. But if we realize this, we can have the best
                of both
                worlds-performers to inspire us, teachers to guide us. </div>

            <div class="p">——————————————————————————————<br>
                *-Benny Goodman's 1935 concert at the Palamar was the first instance of the kind of energy teens in mass
                would
                later put towards Elvis and the Beatles.</div>
            <div class="p">**- I recently did an in-depth interview with Jonathan Stout where he goes into pretty
                descriptive detail about
                how he gears everything his band does towards dancers. Look for it on Swungover soon.</div>
            <div class="p">***-One could argue there's a bit of a logical circle here: I theorize showing off is a part
                of the original
                spirit of the jitterbugs; based on the evidence that I've seen it in most of the old clips and read
                about it in
                autobiographies of great dancers-clips which were taped for the purpose of showing off the dance, and
                great
                dancers who were made great by their ability to show off. See the problem? There could have been many
                more
                average dancers who never showed off that we don't see because they were never special enough dancers to
                be put
                in a clip or to write a book about their life. So, if we looked onto a dance floor of the 1930s, it
                might not
                stick out that showing off was necessarily a part of the spirit of the jitterbugs.</div>
            <div class="p">But to me, this problem isn't really an important one. That's because being a performer,
                entertaining people (if
                only yourself), exploring one's creativity, and making athletic demands on your body all seem to match
                perfectly
                the swing music that is being danced to. Swing music, filled with musicians showing off their solos, and
                bands
                showing how hard they can swing. It is in this sense I believe it is part of the spirit of the original
                Jitterbuggers. One might argue that Pure Balboa is an exception, which I mention later in the footnotes.
            </div>
            <div class="p">Being an actor and ham, I'm fine with showing off being a part of the dance. I've recently
                taken a long, deep
                inward look at myself and realized I should be a lot better at it, considering who I was as a young boy.
                If he
                saw me today, my twelve-year-old self would say “What's your problem? Why aren't you hogging all the
                attention
                in the room?” I think one reason I (and other dancers) choke a lot in modern competitions is because (as
                mentioned in the essay text) we're not used to focusing on one-upping each other. We're not used to
                allowing
                that competitive drive and confidence to take over at the very moment it needs to. The pressure which is
                crushed
                so easily by confidence becomes an impenetrable fortress with the lack of it. I think it's one reason
                why so
                many So-Cal dancers handle competitions well-the one-upness attitude and showing-off confidence has been
                an
                important part of their scene ever since the neo-swing craze and before.</div>
            <div class="p">****-It's like the rare-but-very-powerful Lennon/McCartney syndrome. John Lennon and Paul
                McCartney were talented
                in their own right, but always inspired and pushed each other to write better and better songs, in what
                was an
                incredibly productive competitive environment. To demonstrate, I will now get Hey Jude stuck in your
                head.
                Naa-na-na-nananaaaaaaa….</div>
            <div class="p">*****-This is where I'd like to mention Pure Balboa briefly. Pure Balboa was a chest-to-chest
                dance developed on
                packed dance floors. If swing music is a relaxed explosion of energy, then Pure Balboa dancers emphasize
                the
                relaxed part of it more than the explosion part. It was a dance done mainly by sweethearts, and on a
                packed
                dance floor where people aren't going to see many steps. So, showing off becomes a lot more
                partner-focused, and
                more internal. What a Pure Balboa dancer shows off in leading/following and creativity is smoothness,
                finesse,
                subtly. Not having video of the original Pure Balboa dancers, I can't say for sure whether it looked
                like
                showing off was part of their dance. But I believe it was still there, again, almost part of the music.
            </div>
            <div class="p">******-Partially to blame is the fact is that competition in modern Lindy Hop has the hope of
                actually leading
                someplace-whereas to the original dancers, swing dancing was just a beloved hobby. An original dancer
                wasn't
                going to teach the dance and make hundreds, like today. A 1930s Jitterbug wasn't going to have
                admiration and
                recognition beyond his ballroom peers, other than simply being a stage performer with a novelty act. The
                other
                factor is that people try to break down the “rules” of winnign based on what they see win, and so start
                to
                structure their dancing around winning contests. Though it's good to explore the performance aspect of
                contests,
                this idea of competitors gearing their dancing to win all to easily becomes a Frankenstein that takes
                over a
                dancers chance at honest self-expression if not kept in check. </div>
