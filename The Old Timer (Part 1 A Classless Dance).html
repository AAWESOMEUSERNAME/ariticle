                    In trying to capture the true spirit of the original
                    swing dancers, I realize often how much I fail
                    at doing so. I think that, to some degree, the modern scene as a whole has this problem. Look at an
                    old Jitterbug picture, and chances are there's something about it that we wouldn't quite capture in
                    a dance picture taken today.
                    <div class="ch">
                        当我想去描述真正的根源精神时，我时常感到力不从心。我想，某种程度上，整个现代大环境都存在这样的困扰。
                        当你去看Jitterbug的旧照片时，经常会感觉到一些看现代照片感受不到的东西。
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="p">This is much more true for video clips. For instance, a few of us Balboa teachers work
                    very hard to
                    figure out why the "Venice Beach Clip" dancers look the way they do, and why we don't look like
                    them. I believe before we can start recovering that spirit of the original swing dancers, we first
                    have to understand how different they are from us. By which I mean this: Even though we may all be
                    desiring to express ourselves to the same great music, the original dancers came at that expression
                    from different paths, and I think that produced a different dance than we have today.
                    <div class="ch">
                        看视频时更是如此。比如现在我们有一些Balboa老师努力想搞清楚为什么“Venice Beach Clip”中的舞者与我们如此不同。
                        我相信在我们揭示根源舞者的精神之前，需要先明白我们和他们有多不同。我想说的是：尽管我们和他们都渴望在同样伟大的音乐中
                        表达自我，根源舞者们最终表达的方式却不太一样，以至于我们跳的好像不是同样的东西。
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="h2">A Classless Dance
                <div class="ch">没有教学的舞蹈</div>
            </div>
            <div class="p">We often joke in classes how the original dancers are absolutely terrible at teaching the
                dance. A
                lot of the crotchety southern California old timers would teach with only the words "no", "nope,"
                and "you're doing it all wrong." If you asked them what step they just did, they'd do it again,
                different, swearing that they did it the same as the first time. It's not their fault. In fact, it
                reminds me of my father who tried to teach me how to drive stick in his corvette, which he loved at
                least half as much as my mom, whom he loved more than anything in the world. He couldn't explain
                things very well and got very frustrated about it, especially after the sound the car made when I
                interpreted his instructions. The reason why he couldn't teach it is because it's something he
                learned to do himself, something he had perfected his own way of doing through countless years of
                trial and error, and something he had never been asked to teach before.
                <div class="ch">
                    上课时我们经常开玩笑调侃那些根源舞者教课真的很糟糕。很多反复无常的南加州老舞者教课的时候只会说“错了”、“不对”和“你做的什么玩意儿”。
                    如果你请他们演示一下刚才的动作，他们会再做一遍和前一次不完全一样的动作，并坚称做的是同一个东西。这倒也不是他们的错。其实这让我
                    想起我爸在他的跑车（这个世界上他的第二挚爱，仅次于我妈）里教我开手动挡。他不太能解释清楚状况，这令他十分受挫，特别是当我一通操作
                    后汽车发出的声音打断了他的演示时。他教不好我的原因是，开车这事他完全是自己摸索的，花了很多年去试错和锻炼探索出了自己的一套完整的方法，
                    以前也从来没教过别人。
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="p">One of the large differences between the original jitterbugs and us is that we are almost all
                taught
                how to dance by instructors. This simply was not true for a lot of the original dancers, which is
                why they, for the most part, aren't good instructors. [clarification: Not because you have to learn
                from a teacher to be a good teacher, but because the idea of breaking down the dance and teaching it
                was something many of them didn't hold as a priority.] People like Frankie Manning, who ran a troupe
                of dancers and was expected to train them, and Dean Collins, who was passionate about teaching and
                breaking down the dance, were pretty large exceptions to the rule. For the most part, dancers
                learned by going to a dance and trying to steal stuff they saw others do, or by trying to make up
                new stuff. (Frankie Manning has said he was known as the biggest thief in the Savoy Ballroom.)
                Anyone who has tried to learn by this method today knows the result: in trying to steal something
                from someone else, you get it wrong, and in doing so invent a new step.
                <div class="ch">
                    我们和老舞者们一个很大的区别是，我们基本都是在教师指导下学习如何跳舞的。很多老舞者可不是这样的，这也是他们没能成为好老师的主要原因。
                    （注：这里不是说你必须是老师教出来的才会教别人，而是说教学这件事在他们中的很多人那里没有太高优先级。）不过像Frankie Manning这种运作
                    了一个舞团并且想要训练他们，又如Dean Collins在拆解舞蹈并在教学上极富热情的人就是特别的例外了。大多数时候，老舞者们通过去跳舞并
                    偷学别人的东西，或者通过创造新的东西来成长。（Frankie Manning说过他当年在Savoy舞厅是公认的盗圣。）任何在现在尝试过这种
                    学习方式的人都知道结果会怎样：偷学别人的东西，你会做错，这会使你做出一些新的东西。
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="p">In a several ways, this style of learning is actually more productive for certain dancers
                than the
                modern take-a-class style. Let me explain: The act of taking a class could be looked at as being
                spoon-fed a dance education. To get better, or to create their own look, most of the original
                dancers had to be very pro-active about learning how to dance. After seeing a move they wanted to
                steal, they'd probably have to try it out right away, before they forgot what it looked like. They'd
                make up material often, and before they'd go out to a dance, they'd probably practice the new stuff
                they were working on to try out that night.
                <div class="ch">
                    各种方面上，这种学习方式对某些舞者来说比上课更富成效。因为通过上课来学习就像是拿勺子把知识喂到嘴边，是一种被动的舞蹈教学方式。
                    为了跳的更好，或者创造出自己独有的姿态，大部分根源舞者不得不万分主动得学习。看到了他们想偷的东西后，他们可能不得不在自己忘记
                    之前马上就去尝试。他们也经常自己编一些东西，并且，在去跳舞之前还会先练习一下晚上要跳的新玩意儿。
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="p">Working so hard to learn something by yourself without a teacher is a very personal thing. It
                makes
                the product of that learning a child, complete with some amount of the love, protection, and pride
                that connection infers. Something tells me this is an important part of the puzzle of the original
                jitterbug spirit. The great dancers you see in the past probably don't look like any other dancers,
                because they worked hard to build up their own personal style of swing dance. (Side note: the only
                reasons why others of the era look like Frankie or Dean is probably because Frankie or Dean taught
                them).
                <div class="ch">
                    在没有老师的情况下，如此努力的学习某些东西是一件很个人的事情。这使得学习的最终产出就像是自己的孩子，你对之充满爱意，想要保护，并为之骄傲。
                    我隐约觉得，这是根源精神之谜中很重要的一部分。
                    你能看到过去的伟大舞者可能和其他任何的舞者都不一样，因为他们努力构建了自己独有的摇摆舞风格。（注：有些其他舞者看起来很像Frankie或者Dean,
                    唯一原因可能是这些舞者就是Frankie和Dean教出来的）。
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="p">A note on followers: imagine a follower that never took a class in her life. She had no idea
                what any
                "steps" were, she only stepped under her feet and it was up to the leader to move her around. This
                meant a leader would absolutely have to lead what he wanted to do, and a follower would always step
                right under herself.
                <div class="ch">
                    关于followers：想象一下一个一辈子没上过课的fo。她完全不知道什么“舞步”，只是保持姿势，等着leader去带领移动。这意味着
                    leader必须去实际带领他想做的，而follower总会保持自己的脚步在自己可以控制的范围内。
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="p">The downside to all of this is that the original dancers didn't really have a lot of, well,
                gentleness. We can tell because in a lot of the clips, it's obvious the followers are being muscled
                around, and that sheer pulling/pushing is doing work body leading could be doing much better. Also,
                different dancers might have different leading/following rules, or not many rules at all (at least,
                consistent ones).
                <div class="ch">
                    上述一切也带来了一个缺点——根源舞者跳舞其实不是特别的温柔。这么说的根据是在很多老的影视片段里，fo很明显是被甩来甩去的，
                    而那些突然的推、拉如果用身体带领去做才会更好。并且，不同的舞者可能有不同的领舞/跟舞规则，或者直接没什么规则（至少没什么始终如一的规则）。
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="p">Obviously, the classes-is-spoon-feeding statement is an extreme description, and I don't want
                you to
                think for a second that I'm suggesting the modern scene stop taking classes. I think the benefits of
                classes far outweigh the cons (especially for women's arms). Teaching is incredibly important to any
                modern swing dancer because it means you don't have to reinvent the wheel by trying to learn swing
                mechanics on your own. Because of classes, modern dancers have a much bigger range of movement, much
                deeper understanding of technique, I believe, and much more inspiration for what they can
                accomplish. And though a follower can learn an awful lot about swing dancing by thinking about how
                an original follower would have danced having never had a class, the original follower's couldn't do
                half of the super advanced things a modern master follower could do who used modern frame and
                following techniques.
                <div class="ch">
                    显然，“上课=用勺子喂”这样的陈述是偏激的，我也不想让你觉得我在建议当代环境停止上课。
                    我觉得上课的好处还是明显大于坏处的（特别是对于女士们的胳膊）。
                    对于现代舞者来说教学是无比重要的，因为这意味着你不用通过自己摸索原理去重复造轮子。
                    因为课程的存在，现代舞者有更多的舞步，对技巧有更深的理解，我也相信他们能从自己跳的舞中获得更多的灵感。
                    尽管一个follower，可以通过思考根源follower在没上过课的情况下如何跳舞，来获得大量的成长，但根源follower恐怕做不到哪怕一半一个当代
                    大师follower通过运用现代框架和跟舞技巧能做的高阶动作。
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="p">Besides, here's the best news: it's easy to get the best of both worlds by going to classes
                AND trying to steal/create the way the old timers did.
                <div class="ch">
                    此外，好消息是：我们可以很方便的一边上课，一边像老舞者那样偷动作或创造动作。
