                In thinking about the dancing life of the old timers, something perhaps deceptively important is how
                consistent the music would have been to an original dancer: any swing music you would have heard at
                the Savoy in 1939 would have pretty much the same feeling; dancers didn’t have to change much about
                their pulse or style of dancing like a modern dancer, who might one moment be expected to dance to a
                1925 Charleston song, the next a late period boogie woogie, and the next a 1950s Count Basie song,
                all of which ask for very different takes on the same basic movements.<sup>1</sup> I believe this meant
                an
                original dancer could get “into a groove” better throughout a night of dancing than a modern dancer
                might, not having to change the fundamental pulse and style hardly any at a night of dancing. (This
                leads to another topic which will be discussed in part 4.)
                <div class="ch">
                    在思考根源舞者的跳舞生活时，有一个很容易被忽略却十分重要点是在根源舞者的世界里音乐是始终如一的——你在1939年的Savoy能听到的摇摆乐听起来的感觉都是一样的，那时舞者们不用时常改变自己的律动和跳舞风格，不像现在的舞者，一会儿跳1925年的查尔斯顿舞，一会儿又跳晚期boogie woogie，紧接着可能又是一首1950年代的Count Basie，这些不同的曲子在同样的基础动作上却有着不同要求。<sup>1</sup> 我相信这意味着根源舞者，在一整晚不需要怎么突然改变基础律动和风格的情况下，舞会期间可以比现代舞者更容易“进入大律动”。（这个可以延申至我在第四部分将要讨论的一个话题。）
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="p">
                This confinement to a certain style of music would have been a limitation, a box, that helped shape
                the dance. Another great limitation we probably don’t think about much today would have been how
                many other styles of swing dancing an original jitterbugger would have seen.
                <div class="ch">
                    特定音乐风格的限制作为一种局限，像是一个“盒子”，塑造了舞蹈的基本形态。另一个我们现在可能不会想太多的重要局限是根源舞者们其实没见过多少种风格的摇摆舞。
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="p">I don’t think we can underestimate how much bigger the world was in the 1930s than it is now.
                If you were a regular working or middle-class person in the era, there was very little chance you had
                ever gone halfway around the country, much less dreamed of going abroad on vacation.
                <div class="ch">
                    我们不能低估的是1930年代的世界其实比现在要“大”很多。如果你是个普通工人或者那个年代的中产阶级，你基本不太可能走过半个国家，更别说出国度假了。
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="p">
                This meant, as a swing-dancer in the 1930s, you probably hardly ever saw anyone dance who wasn’t from
                your region.
                You might have taken train trips, or moved to a different city, but this was relatively few people
                compared to today.
                You might also have seen all the swing dance movies, like <em>Buck Privates,</em> but you’d have to
                spend a lot of money to be able to fathom what was going on with the dancing, since the movie would only
                play for a few weeks then be gone until the VCR came out fifty years later.
                Swing dancer and clip-studier Nick Williams, on the other hand, has probably seen <em>Buck Privates</em>
                hundreds of times, much more than anyone in the original swing era ever has.
                <div class="ch">
                    这意味着，作为一个1930年代的舞者，你可能只看过同区域的人跳舞。你也可能坐火车去旅行，或者搬去另一个城市，但是相比现在而言，这样的人很少。你可能看过所有有关摇摆舞的电影，比如《列兵巴克（Buck Privates）》，但是你要是想彻底搞清楚里面的舞蹈，得花不少钱，因为电影只放映几个星期就会下映，再想看就要等到50年后VCR的出现了。然而，摇摆舞者-老录像学习达人-Nick William可能看过几百遍《列兵巴克》，比任何摇摆年代的根源舞者都要多。
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="p">
                So, there were obvious differences in the way people danced based on region.<sup>2</sup>
                There are lots of stories about how in some regions, even <em>individual high schools</em> had their own
                dance styles, and local teenagers could spot rival high-schoolers based on how they danced.
                <div class="ch">
                    因此，不同地区的人跳舞是显著不同的。<sup>2</sup>有各种各样的故事表明在一个区域，即便是不同的高中也会有不同的舞蹈风格，当地的年轻人还可以通过别人的舞蹈风格认出对方属于哪个对手学校。
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="p">The modern swing scene, however, has Herrang.
                It has relatively cheap airfare and planes that go anywhere.
                It has, most importantly, You Tube.
                Three hours after a contest happens in New Orleans, a Korean dancer can download it and see what Lindy
                Hop in New Orleans looks like.
                The upside, of course, is that someone in Korea, who never had a chance to see Lindy Hop before, can see
                all they want to now.
                And that’s awesome when you think about it.
                The downside, ironically, is that a year from now, Lindy Hop from Korea may very well cease to look any
                different from Lindy Hop in New Orleans.
                Of course this is too extreme to happen to such an extent, but there’s no doubt that, even
                compared to five years ago, regional differences in dancing are a lot less dramatic.
                <div class="ch">
                    而现代舞圈，有Herrang，有相对便宜的机票和可以去往任何地方的航班，最重要的，有油管（Youtube）。新奥尔良举办一场比赛三四个小时之后，一个韩国舞者就可以下载观看。往好的方面想，显然，一个曾经不会有机会看到Lindy Hop的韩国舞者，现在可以如愿看到任何有关Lindy Hop的东西。想一想就觉得很棒。往坏的方面想，讽刺的是，自那以后韩国的Lindy Hop可能会变得和新奥尔良的基本没有什么差别。当然这种故事发展说的过于极端了，但是毫无疑问的是，即使和5年前作比较，地域舞蹈差异也已经不那么引人注意了。
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="p">Why are regional differences important?
                It’s tempting to theorize that since the original dancers had only a few local hot shots for
                inspiration, and an occasional movie, their relative isolation gave them a better opportunity to develop
                individual styles.
                What I mean to say is, having tons of resources isn’t necessarily good for creativity, which often does
                its best work under a certain amount of limits and obstacles.
                Yes, the original jitterbugs dance floor might have been empty in
                terms of dancers that they could get inspiration from.
                But a creative person would look at an empty
                dance floor and see all the spaces they could fill.
                <div class="ch">
                    为什么地域差异很重要呢？这引出了下一个理论：根源舞者们只能从少数的本地顶尖舞者以及不定期的电影中获得启发，这种相对的封闭给了他们更好的机会去发展自己独有的风格。我想说的是，拥有成千上万的资源并不必然有利于创造，反而是一定的限制和阻碍更容易激发潜能。是的，根源摇摆者们的舞池里或许缺乏可以供人汲取灵感的舞者，但是在一个充满创造力的人眼里，这里满是可以填满的空间。
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="p">
                You Tube is, to be sure, an incredibly good resource for anyone wanting to dance, and I
                wouldn’t have it taken away for anything.
                It’s brought inspirational dancing to far too many people who wouldn’t have been able to see it
                otherwise.
                And for me, its an incredibly good resource to study dance, and write long essays such as this, but I
                have to keep myself in check, lest I allow my focus in dance to become mainly looking at other people
                enjoy a great swing song while I sit in a chair with bad posture.<sup>3</sup>
                <div class="ch">
                    油管对想要跳舞的人来说确实是极好的资源，这点我觉得不容否认。油管给太多本来甚至没机会看到摇摆舞的人带来了予人灵感的舞蹈。于我，油管是研究舞蹈、写现在这种长文的绝佳资源，但是我需要时刻告诫自己，不要让自己对舞蹈的关注演变成只会葛优瘫在沙发里看别人享受那些绝佳摇摆乐的活动。<sup>3</sup>

                The boxes that we put our dancing into are different boxes than the old timers had.
                Whereas they had boxes mainly of regional confinement, style of music, and a stricter idea of social
                behavior, we don’t. (The evidence of which is nicely summed up in the words “Blues exchange.”)
                Often, we’ve put our own boxes around a lot of our dancing, like in the late 90s/early 2000s, when we’d
                almost purposefully constrict ourselves with boxes labeled “Hollywood Style” or “Savoy Style” or
                “Groove,” only to leap right back out of those boxes after stuffing ourselves in them for a few years.
                These boxes were, I think, a lot more artistically confining than any of the boxes the original
                jitterbuggers had.
                They are also, for the most part, gone, but one could argue we now have the burden of choice: Too many
                possibilities.<sup>4</sup>
                <div class="ch">
                    我们现在用以承载自己舞蹈的“盒子”已经不同于根源舞者。根源舞者们舞蹈的限制主要是地域限制，音乐风格，严格的社交礼仪，而我们不是。（很显而易见的证据就是我们有“Blues exchange”这种活动）我们也经常给我们的舞蹈加上诸多限制，比如90年代末或2000年初，我们有目的性的把我们自己框定在各种贴着“好莱坞风格”、“Savoy风格”、“Groove”这样标签的盒子里，直到几年后自己又跳了出来。我认为我们给自己的这些限制比根源舞者面临的限制更富艺术性。现在大部分限制已经不复存在了，但是值得讨论的是，我们现在有了新的负担：太多的可能性。<sup>4</sup>

                World War II, of course, quickly brought the rest of the world to almost every person in America.
                Men who had never stepped outside of their state met Europe and Asia up close and personal.
                When they went home, for most of them it was time to find a job, start a family, and very few kept up
                the youthful hobby they loved.
                Even if they had wanted to continue swing dancing regularly, the music wasn’t around much after the war,
                as jazz had turned to Bee-Bop.
                Except for a few groups of dancers in California and New York who continued to meet up and dance or
                perform over the next seventy years, the original jitterbug was, for the most part, extinct.

                    接下来近70年里，除了加州和纽约还有少数几群舞者会聚集起来跳舞或演出，对大多数人来说，根源舞者灭绝了。

            <div class="p">
                1. One could argue this gives an unsuspected regional bias in modern competitions. Imagine you spend
                most of your week dancing to 1950s Count Basie at your local club, and then enter a contest at a big
                out-of-town workshop weekend. They start-off with a 1920s Bechet number, and you try your best; even
                though you might be a much better technical dancer than those in the comp who dance to that style of
                music all night at their weekly club, there’s a very good chance that won’t show in the competition.
                Hopefully you go home realizing you either need to practice to all kinds of music if you want to be
                a competitor, or you simply should choose very carefully what contests you enter.
                <div class="ch">
                    1. 有人可能会说，放在现在的比赛里，这无疑会导致地域歧视。想象一下你几乎每周都在本地的俱乐部跳1950年代Count Basie的曲子，然后参加了一个大型外地活动的比赛。一开始放的是1920年代Sidney Bechet的一些曲子，你尽力跳了。即使你在技术上比其他的参赛选手要强，可那些选手们每周都伴着同种风格的曲子跳舞，很大概率的结果是，你无法在比赛中脱颖而出。顺利话你回家就会意识到，如果你想做一个比赛选手，你就需要练习所有风格的音乐，或者以后在参加比赛的时候相当有选择性的参加。
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="p">Now however, I think the regional bias has given way to the workshop weekend competitor.
                This is a person who does well in competitions because they spend most of their money and time going to
                events with competitions and where the music they dance to is the music they will hear in competitions.
                They might not even go out dancing in their own town, because they spend all their dancing energy
                away.
                <div class="ch">
                    然而我想说，我认为这种地域歧视不会影响到这种周末参加活动比赛的选手。这是一个很擅长比赛的人，因为他花了大部分的钱和时间去参加周末活动和比赛，并且他们跳的音乐都和比赛用的音乐是同种类型的。这样的人甚至可能不在自己的镇上跳舞，因为他们的精力都消耗在比赛和活动里了。
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="p">2. The differences were obvious enough for people in the late 1990s to deem them styles, like
                “Hollywood” and “Savoy” style, which, at the time, was to help people see those differences in
                styles, but, in hindsight, ballooned out of control and undercut (1) the similarities of dance the
                mechanics both styles shared with each other, and (2) the individuality of many of the dancers
                involved. For instance, put Hal Takier between Frankie Manning and Dean Collins, and it’d be very
                hard to put a label on him.

                    2. 这种差异是显而易见的，以至于1990年代后期人们会去定义他们的风格，比如“好莱坞”和“Savoy”风格。那时定义风格的主要目的是帮助人们看到不同风格间的区别，但是，事后诸葛亮一下，这最终导致了失控并忽视了（1）不同风格间的相似性和共有的机理（2）相关舞者自身的独立性。举个例子，把Hal Takier放到Frankie Manning和Dean Collins之间，你会发现很难把Hal Takier归类。

                3. In the 1980s, rock music discovered the synthesizer (trust me, I’m going somewhere with this.)
                The result was that almsot every song had loud, obnoxious synthesizer, taking a new technology and
                focusing so much on it, and having it mess up almost every good melody, before Depeche Mode came to
                the party and told everyone to chill the fuck out and showed them how it was done. I think that we
                are still running rampant a little with all the technical improvements in the world. I’m not anti-or
                pro-technology; it is a tool, and can be used for good or evil. So I’m very happy we have the
                ability to do all this stuff with technology, but I’ don’t think I’m at a point yet where I’m using
                it only to better my life. For example: I try now to allow myself to check email only twice a day,
                unless I’m awaiting something important: this save me roughly ten hours of daylight to do other
                things.

                    3. 1980年代，摇滚乐迎来了合成器（别慌，接着读。）结果几乎所有的歌都开始用大声的惹人烦的合成器，拿到新技术就死命用，好的旋律全被毁了，直到Depeche Mode出现并对着闹剧上的众人说道:都他妈安静点我给你看看该怎么玩。我想随着技术的进步我们仍没有摆脱这样的顽疾。我不是一个极端科技狂热者或反科技者，科技只是个工具，并且可以被用在好的事情上，也可以被用在坏的技术上。我对我们可以利用科技做到的事情感到开心，但是我不觉得我把技术都用在了好的方面。举个例子：我现在尝试每天只看两次邮箱，除非在等什么重要的事情：这大概为我节约出10个小时去做其他事情。

            <div class="p">4. There’s a great TED talk <a
                    href="http://www.amazon.com/Paradox-Choice-Why-More-Less/dp/0060005696/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1268756899&amp;sr=8-1">
                    (promoting a book written by) Barry Schwartz </a> which talks about how too many choices leads to
                unhappiness rather than more happiness. Basically, the modern person has so many choices that blame
                for not being happy with something is placed on the modern person. Schwartz puts it really well in
                an anecdote about himself buying jeans: He had the same pair of basic jeans for ten years, never had
                a problem. Goes to buy new jeans, realizes there are fifty varieties, he gets fitted, buys a pair,
                and knows the jeans fit and look better than his old pair of jeans. But he’s not actually happy,
                because he can’t help but think there is yet another pair of jeans that would fit even better, or
                look better, if he just looked a little harder. He concludes: in the old days, there was only one
                pair of jeans, and so if something didn’t fit right or look right, it was the world’s fault, not
                yours, and you could move on with your life a lot happier and sooner. Thus, too many options and
                choices tend to give people the unhappy feeling that there might always be something
                more/greater/perfect out there.

                    对应的书：《选择的悖论》 Barry Schwartz <br>
                    这个演讲的主题是大量的选择为何带来的不快比快乐更多。现代人被强加了太多选择以至于感到不快乐。Schwartz很好的用自己的买牛仔裤轶事来说明：10年来他一直穿同样一条基础款牛仔裤，从来没什么问题。当他去买的新牛仔裤时，发现有50多种，他挑了一条合身的买了，也知道这条裤子比他的老牛仔裤更合适更好看。但他实际上并不开心，因为他不禁会想，如果他再努力找找，或许还有另外一条裤子比现在这条更好看更合身。他由此得出结论：在过去的日子里，只有一条裤子，如果不舒服或者不好看，那是世界的错，不是你的，然后你就可以很快的继续快乐生活。因此，过多的选择导致人们因为总觉得还有更好的而不快乐。
