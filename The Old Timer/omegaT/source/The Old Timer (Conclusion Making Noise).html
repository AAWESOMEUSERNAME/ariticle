                <div class="h2">Conclusion: Making Noise</div>
                <div class="p">Most of us feel something very powerful when we listen to a great swing song, or watch
                    <em>Hellzapoppin</em>. And we try to capture that feeling–the feeling Frankie Manning had plastered
                    on his face every time he danced. I think it’s particularly easy for many modern dancers to fall
                    into the trap that, if you know the moves, and try to emulate the way someone else does them, then
                    you’ll be able express that same feeling–but that’s like looking at a map and a picture of a place
                    and thinking you’ve been there.
                </div>
                <div class="p">When I look back at the dance floors of the last ten years, I see a lot of things (A lot
                    of which I
                    saw in myself, as well). A shot of the late 1990s shows me that most people thought swing dancing
                    was a Gap ad: nothing but turns, kicks and aerials. A shot of the early 2000s show me that a lot of
                    people thought swing was perfectly recreating Hollywood movie dancers, or trying to be as musical as
                    possible with a groove style. A look at the late-2000s dance floor shows me that a lot of people
                    think a Charleston pulse should be danced to all swing music regardless of how smooth it is. All of
                    which point to calculating our dancing based on what we see others do versus what we <em>feel</em>
                    like doing when we ourselves listen to the music.</div>
                <div class="p">Perhaps the spirit of the original jitterbugs is as simple as that: All they knew about
                    swing was
                    what they heard when they stepped onto the dance floor.</div>
                <div class="p">It’s beautifully simple and honest, and shows <em>why</em> certain aspects of the modern
                    scene in the
                    last ten years look different than the original dancers. A great original dancer might only know
                    five basic moves, but they could do those moves all night long, and happily, because they could
                    dance the shit out of those five moves. And those five moves would all be done with a personal,
                    individual style. If it wasn’t swing music, then you weren’t going to do swing to it. And if you
                    felt like making noise, you screamed or yelled or whooped or giggled.</div>
                <div class="p">As ideal as that sounds, I think I would be doing a disservice to ourselves and the
                    original dancers
                    if we treat them only with nostalgia: pretending times were automatically better then, and
                    everything they did was better than now. Certainly this is not the case. As a whole, our technique,
                    our understanding of dance mechanics, and micro musicality is a lot better than the original
                    dancers, and many of them have stated as much. But I do think, like we all too often do in the
                    modern times, we have adopted and progressed something without paying close attention to where it
                    came from.</div>
                <div class="p">Though classes, counts, and moves can make us really great dancers, the spirit of the
                    original
                    jitterbug doesn’t originate there. It wasn’t what they did; it was the way they did it.</div>
